## This repo contains all the solutions to the assignments given in Andrew Ng's course.

### All the problems statements are enclosed in .pdf format inside each of the directories.

These programs can be run easily using either matlab or octave.

### Brief description of the solutions are as follows:

#### EX - 1

Implementing and visualizing linear regression using gradient descent as optimizer.
(Accuracy)
